We did the peer review with everyone at once. I noticed a lot more differences this way,
I think it is superior to one on one review.

Exercise 1
Mehmet used a ToString() override to print his Article. This is the way I would prefer to do it, but the exercise asked for
a printer class specifically, so we did that instead.

Exercise 2
Everything was the same

Exercise 3
Tarah split name into first and last name, I did not
The getter for the telephone number was unused, but the exercise demanded it so we left it in
Mike used setters to assign properties without a constructor. While it works, we agreed that it is best to use the constructor
and only use setters for modifications
I checked for the empty string manually, while Mike used the predefined method isBlank() or isEmpty(). IsBlank() works best for this exercise so
I used it as well

Exercise 4
I should have used a loop for asking about the steps, but I used a method and called it 3 times
I used variables for readability (kmPerStep)
We dicussed when to use static and when to use instances of a service class. IMO static is always the better option if you are not changing any fields

Exercise 5
same discussion about static vs instance
